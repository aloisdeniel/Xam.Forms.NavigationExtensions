public class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        MainPage = new NavigationPage(new HomePage());
    }

    protected override async void OnStart()
    {
        // If the app is launched one hour after its last stop, its navigation history 
        // will be restored.
        await this.MainPage.Navigation.RestoreAsync("Main", TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
    }

    protected override void OnSleep()
    {
        this.MainPage.Navigation.Store("Main");
    }
}
```
